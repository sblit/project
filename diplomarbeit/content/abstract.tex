This diploma project aims at creating free software for file synchronization over the internet.
Central elements like servers should be avoided in order to prevent unauthorized individuals from accessing the system.
Instead of storing files in data centers, which is the case with conventional cloud providers, data is split into small, encrypted blocks and then stored on other users' devices.

While other file synchronization services implement a classic client-server infrastructure, this project utilizes a decentralized peer-to-peer network for communication.
Problems that emerge due to the distribution of data in small, encrypted blocks and due to the use of a decentralized peer-to-peer network should be solved in this thesis.
Those problems include decentralized addressing, decentralized routing, fairness of mutual memory allocation, security as well as efficiency of both communication and synchronization and solving synchronization conflicts.
